## Motivation ðŸ“°
After learning about how a business operates and the challenges they face in managing their inventory, I was motivated to create an application that could streamline the process and save businesses time and money. I realized that manually tracking stock levels and reordering items could be a tedious and time-consuming task, and that there was a need for a solution that could automate the process and provide businesses with actionable insights.

Through my research and discussions with business owners, I identified the pain points in inventory management and began to develop an application that could address these issues. I was driven to create an application that could automate the stock ordering process, analyze sales trends, and help businesses optimize their inventory to reduce costs and minimize the risk of stockouts.

My goal was to create a user-friendly application that could be easily integrated into a business's existing workflow, and that could be accessed from the convenience of their terminal. With StockMate, I hope to empower businesses to take control of their inventory management and make data-driven decisions to improve their operations.
