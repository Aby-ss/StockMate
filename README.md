## Motivation ðŸ“°
After learning about how a business operates and the challenges they face in managing their inventory, I was motivated to create an application that could streamline the process and save businesses time and money. I realized that manually tracking stock levels and reordering items could be a tedious and time-consuming task, and that there was a need for a solution that could automate the process and provide businesses with actionable insights.

Through my research and discussions with business owners, I identified the pain points in inventory management and began to develop an application that could address these issues. I was driven to create an application that could automate the stock ordering process, analyze sales trends, and help businesses optimize their inventory to reduce costs and minimize the risk of stockouts.

My goal was to create a user-friendly application that could be easily integrated into a business's existing workflow, and that could be accessed from the convenience of their terminal. With StockMate, I hope to empower businesses to take control of their inventory management and make data-driven decisions to improve their operations.

## Goals for Stockmate ðŸ“ˆ
An inventory management software should be capable of performing several key tasks to help businesses effectively manage their inventory. Some of these tasks include:

- **Tracking inventory levels**: The software should be able to track the current inventory levels of each product, so businesses can monitor when they need to restock items.

- **Managing purchase orders**: The software should be able to generate purchase orders for products that need to be restocked, and keep track of orders as they are placed and received.

- **Forecasting demand**: The software should be able to use past sales data and other information to forecast future demand for products, so businesses can plan for the future and adjust their inventory levels accordingly.

- **Managing suppliers**: The software should be able to store information about suppliers and their products, so businesses can easily contact suppliers when they need to place orders.

- **Analyzing inventory data**: The software should be able to provide reports and analytics on inventory data, such as sales trends, inventory turnover, and product profitability, so businesses can make informed decisions about their inventory management.

- **Barcode scanning**: The software should be able to integrate with barcode scanners to make it easier to manage inventory levels and track products as they move in and out of the warehouse.

- **Integrating with other systems**: The software should be able to integrate with other systems, such as point-of-sale systems or accounting software, to provide a seamless experience for businesses.
